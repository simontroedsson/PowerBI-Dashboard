# Amazon dashboard

The goal of the project was to create a dashboard that vizualizes sales data for a company using Power BI.

## Process
### Database modelling
The first task was to create a database and fill it with sample data that could be used to make visualizations. This was achieved by first listing all the questions that the dashboard needed to answer and then starting to model a database schema that could store this information. When the database model was done and implemented in SSMS I started to fill it with data so I could later import it into Power BI.
